# HTML-Treasure-Hunt-Portofolio
A short portofolio of past work, website fully made in HTML &amp; CSS [nothing else], even with a "treasure hunt" kind-of game on it. Find all the badges and you're good to go

The "Portofolio" itself, it's foolish made, there is no modern UI and stuff like that on it, it's more like a game of logical sense, without anything to distract you.

There are 5 badges that you must gather, once you have them all you can unlock the past-work page, where I show off all my work.
Levels for the badges [Easy -> Impossible]

The levels for the badges indicates how easy it's to get them, from the 2nd badge they are hidden right at your sight *cought*, maybe a developer might find some ;)

Have fun playing around with it, it isn't really my main portofolio but this one is made for fun, and to engage with people that check it out.
